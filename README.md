# LED-MATRIX
## SUMMARY
The "digital circuit design" part of this project is a design of 16x16 LEDs matrix, controlled by PNPs and NPNs BJTs, which in turn are controlled by shift registers, and lastly - RPI Pico.
The "software" side of the project are subprojects intended to be displayed on the built matrix:(very) simple animation and two basic games: "snake" and "pong".

TODO: 
- more intricate introduction?
- ideas behind the design od the matrix? (in INTRODUCTION or separate heading?)
- explaining some of the code (or nah cuz too long?)
