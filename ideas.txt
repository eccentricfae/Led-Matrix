Ideas for future projects for this led-matrix:
- Snake: difficulty chooser (in form of columns with different height?)
- endless runner
- make the printing to the matrix run on the second core? so that there never 
  are any weird artifacts on the matrix because the uC couldnt process data quicker 
  and had to "abandon" printing to the matrix for a couple of ms (it would require 
  a major refactorization of the whole codebase of the project - IDK if I ahe the time
  and the will to do this :/)
